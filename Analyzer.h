/*
	Class: Analyzer

	The analyzer is the central part of the client component of Capture.

	All malicious events that occur on the system are passed onto the Analyzer,
	where it is formatted to be outputted to the server, stdout, or a file. It
	uses the signal slot design in Boost to achieve a common interface for which
	the monitors can send events to it. These are the on*Event() methods and are
	managed by connecting/binding a particular method in the an Analyzer to a
	particular slot on a monitor. When a malicious event occurs in a monitor,
	the monitor will signal the slot with the event information which is then
	processed by the analyzer.
